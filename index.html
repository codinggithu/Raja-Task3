    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    <p class id="p1">In broad sweep (see Figure 1), the CIS has traditionally been the disseminator/translator<br>
of consensus based scientific information from NCI to broader segments of the public.<br>
Societal trends in consumer/client information behavior make this a critical role in today’s<br>
broadly envisioned clinical practice environment. While the CIS is organized to serve<br>
clients directly, it can also interface with clinical practice by providing referrals,<br>
enhancing health literacy, providing second opinions and crucial background, assur-<br>ance to clients from neutral third party. Thus, the CIS is a partial answer to information<br>
explosion: for client it acts as synthesizer, translator who can relieve clinical settings of<br>
this task and through clients it directly acts to disseminate information to improve clinical<br>
practice.<br>
<br>
This chapter highlights how information providers can interface with clinical practice to<br>
form a strategic partnership that advances health outcomes for the public. All this<br>
suggests the increasing importance of information as a strategic asset that should be<br>
systematically incorporated in the planning of health professionals. Health institutions<br>
need to recognize the potential benefit of marketing unique corporate knowledge and<br>
expertise to other information seekers and to consider their unique role in a complex<br>
information seeking environment. Health professionals also need to lobby the govern-<br>ment to maintain critical information infrastructures.<br>
<br>
While more and more information can be produced more efficiently, there is a concomitant<br>
increase in the costs of consuming (e.g., interpreting, analyzing) this information (More,<br>
1990). Thus, proactively working to shape a client’s information fields by insuring<br>
concordant information is provided may forestall increasing problems for clinical<br>
practice in the rapidly growing information jungle.</p>
